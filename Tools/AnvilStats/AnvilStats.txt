AnvilStats
==========

This is a project for measuring various metrics throughout an Anvil world, presumably created by a vanilla MC.
It works by parsing the MCA files in the path specified as its param (or current directory, if no params) and
feeding each decompressed chunk into the statistics-gathering callback function.

Possible usage:
  - count the per-chunk density of specific blocks
  - count the per-chunk density of dungeons, by measuring the number of zombie/skeleton/regularspider spawners
  - count the per-chunk-per-biome density of trees, by measuring the number of dirt-log vertical transitions, correlating to biome data
  - draw a vertical map of the world based on a specific measured value (biome, elevation, ...)

This project is Windows-only, although it shouldn't be too difficult to make it portable.

Because this project uses NBT extensively, it runs much faster in Release mode.
