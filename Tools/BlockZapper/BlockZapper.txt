/*
This project implements a simple tool that can "zap" blocks out of an Anvil-stored MineCraft world.
It is usually used by server admins when their servers fail with a bug and store an invalid block in the world.
This tool takes a coord triplet and a radius triplet and replaces all blocks within the (new york-metric) radius of the coords with air.
The triplets pair is given on stdin, and multiple such specifiers are allowed, each on a separate file.
If the specifier line ends with an additional " E", entities within that radius are zapped instead of blocks
If the specifier line ends with an additional " BE", both blocks and entities are zapped.

The tool is aware of extended blocktypes (256 .. 4096).

The source code for this tool is public domain, but note that it depends on a few shared sources in Cuberite that may be under other licenses.
