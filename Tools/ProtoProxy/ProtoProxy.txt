ProtoProxy
==========

This is a project to create a proxy for the MineCraft protocol, allowing anyone to view the data sent over a network connection between a client and a server. This, in fact, performs a kind of Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack on the protocol by tapping in between the connection points and providing a decrypter and an encrypter for each.

In order to catch the encryption parameters, the MC protocol needs to be understood at least a little bit at the beginning, when the cryptography parameters are exchanged.

This project is currently Windows-only and I don't plan on making it multi-platform, although the effort needed for doing so should be minimal.

The proxy only works on the localhost connection. It listens on port 25564 and expects the underlying MC server to run on port 25565. Ports can be changed by cmdline args: ProtoProxy <listen-port> <server-port>.

You need to set the server *not* to verify usernames ("online-mode=false" in server.properties) in order to be able to connect through ProtoProxy - since the full server name, including the port, is used for verification, the client uses different servername than the server and thus the verification fails.



ProtoProxy is not much dependent on the protocol - it will work with unknown packets, it just won't parse them into human-readable format.
The latest protocol which has been tested is 1.6.1 (#73).
