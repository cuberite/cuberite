Hello, this script will download and compile Cuberite.
On subsequent runs, it will update Cuberite.
The compilation and download will occur in the current directory.
If you're updating, you should run: <Path to Cuberite>/compile.sh
Compiling from source takes time, but it usually generates faster
executables. If you prefer ready-to-use binaries or if you want
more info, please visit:  https://cuberite.org/"
