--[[
Implements the entire plugin

NOTE: This plugin is not meant for production servers. It is used mainly by developers to verify that things
are working properly when implementing MCServer features. Do not enable this plugin on production servers!

This plugin logs a notification for each hook that is being called by the server.
The TICK and WORLD_TICK hooks are disabled because they produce too much output.
