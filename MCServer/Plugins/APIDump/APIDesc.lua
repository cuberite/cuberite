		cBlockArea =

			Desc = [[
				This class is used when multiple adjacent blocks are to be manipulated. Because of chunking
				and multithreading, manipulating single blocks using {{cWorld|cWorld:SetBlock}}() is a rather
				time-consuming operation (locks for exclusive access need to be obtained, chunk lookup is done
				for each block), so whenever you need to manipulate multiple adjacent blocks, it's better to wrap
				the operation into a cBlockArea access. cBlockArea is capable of reading / writing across chunk
				boundaries, has no chunk lookups for get and set operations and is not subject to multithreading
				locking (because it is not shared among threads).</p>
				<p>
				cBlockArea remembers its origin (MinX, MinY, MinZ coords in the Read() call) and therefore supports
				absolute as well as relative get / set operations. Despite that, the contents of a cBlockArea can
				be written back into the world at any coords.</p>
				<p>
				cBlockArea can hold any combination of the following datatypes:<ul>
					<li>block types</li>
					<li>block metas</li>
					<li>blocklight</li>
					<li>skylight</li>
				</ul>
				Read() and Write() functions have parameters that tell the class which datatypes to read / write.
				Note that a datatype that has not been read cannot be written (FIXME).</p>
				<p>
				Typical usage:<ul>
					<li>Create cBlockArea object</li>
					<li>Read an area from the world / load from file / create anew</li>
					<li>Modify blocks inside cBlockArea</li>
					<li>Write the area back to a world / save to file</li>
				</ul></p>

				cWorld is the game world. It is the hub of all the information managed by individual classes,

				world types. You can have two overworlds, three nethers etc. To enumerate all world the server
				provides, use the {{cRoot}}:ForEachWorld() function.</p>
				<p>
				The world data is held in individual chunks. Each chunk consists of 16 (x) * 16 (z) * 256 (y)
				blocks, each block is specified by its block type (8-bit) and block metadata (4-bit).
				Additionally, each block has two light values calculated - skylight (how much daylight it receives)
				and blocklight (how much light from light-emissive blocks it receives), both 4-bit.</p>
				<p>
				Each world runs several separate threads used for various housekeeping purposes, the most important
				of those is the Tick thread. This thread updates the game logic 20 times per second, and it is
				the thread where all the gameplay actions are evaluated. Liquid physics, entity interactions,
				player ovement etc., all are applied in this thread.</p>
				<p>
				Additional threads include the generation thread (generates new chunks as needed, storage thread
				(saves and loads chunk from the disk), lighting thread (updates block light values) and the
				chunksender thread (compresses chunks to send to the clients).</p>
				<p>
				The world provides access to all its {{cPlayer|players}}, {{cEntity|entities}} and {{cBlockEntity|block
				entities}}. Because of multithreading issues, individual objects cannot be retrieved for indefinite
				handling, but rather must be modified in callbacks, within which they are guaranteed to stay valid.</p>
				<p>
				Physics for individual blocks are handled by the simulators. These will fire in each tick for all
				blocks that have been scheduled for simulator update ("simulator wakeup"). The simulators include
				liquid physics, falling blocks, fire spreading and extinguishing and redstone.</p>
				<p>
				Game time is also handled by the world. It provides the time-of-day and the total world age.
