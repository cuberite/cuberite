*** Important Usage Notes ***

1. If a constructor for A takes a pointer to an object B (except primitive
types such as int and char), then A owns B and will delete B at A's
destruction.  If a constructor for A takes a reference to an object B,
then the caller retains ownership of B and should not destroy it until
A no longer needs it. 

2. Crypto++ is thread safe at the class level. This means you can use
Crypto++ safely in a multithreaded application, but you must provide
synchronization when multiple threads access a common Crypto++ object.

*** MSVC-Specific Information ***

On Windows, Crypto++ can be compiled into 3 forms: a static library
including all algorithms, a DLL with only FIPS Approved algorithms, and
a static library with only algorithms not in the DLL.
(FIPS Approved means Approved according to the FIPS 140-2 standard.)
The DLL may be used by itself, or it may be used together with the second
form of the static library. MSVC project files are included to build
all three forms, and sample applications using each of the three forms
are also included.

To compile Crypto++ with MSVC, open the "cryptest.dsw" (for MSVC 6 and MSVC .NET 
2003) or "cryptest.sln" (for MSVC 2005 - 2010) workspace file and build one or 
more of the following projects:

cryptopp - This builds the DLL. Please note that if you wish to use Crypto++
  as a FIPS validated module, you must use a pre-built DLL that has undergone
  the FIPS validation process instead of building your own.
dlltest - This builds a sample application that only uses the DLL.
cryptest Non-DLL-Import Configuration - This builds the full static library
  along with a full test driver.
cryptest DLL-Import Configuration - This builds a static library containing
  only algorithms not in the DLL, along with a full test driver that uses
  both the DLL and the static library.

To use the Crypto++ DLL in your application, #include "dll.h" before including
any other Crypto++ header files, and place the DLL in the same directory as
your .exe file. dll.h includes the line #pragma comment(lib, "cryptopp")
so you don't have to explicitly list the import library in your project
settings. To use a static library form of Crypto++, make the "cryptlib"
project a dependency of your application project, or specify it as
an additional library to link with in your project settings.
In either case you should check the compiler options to
make sure that the library and your application are using the same C++
run-time libraries and calling conventions.

*** DLL Memory Management ***

Because it's possible for the Crypto++ DLL to delete objects allocated 
by the calling application, they must use the same C++ memory heap. Three 
methods are provided to achieve this.
1.  The calling application can tell Crypto++ what heap to use. This method 
    is required when the calling application uses a non-standard heap.
2.  Crypto++ can tell the calling application what heap to use. This method 
    is required when the calling application uses a statically linked C++ Run 
    Time Library. (Method 1 does not work in this case because the Crypto++ DLL 
    is initialized before the calling application's heap is initialized.)
3.  Crypto++ can automatically use the heap provided by the calling application's 
    dynamically linked C++ Run Time Library. The calling application must
    make sure that the dynamically linked C++ Run Time Library is initialized
    before Crypto++ is loaded. (At this time it is not clear if it is possible
    to control the order in which DLLs are initialized on Windows 9x machines,
    so it might be best to avoid using this method.)

When Crypto++ attaches to a new process, it searches all modules loaded 
into the process space for exported functions "GetNewAndDeleteForCryptoPP" 
and "SetNewAndDeleteFromCryptoPP". If one of these functions is found, 
Crypto++ uses methods 1 or 2, respectively, by calling the function. 
Otherwise, method 3 is used. 

*** GCC-Specific Information ***

A makefile is included for you to compile Crypto++ with GCC. Make sure
you are using GNU Make and GNU ld. The make process will produce two files,
libcryptopp.a and cryptest.exe. Run "cryptest.exe v" for the validation
suite.

*** Documentation and Support ***

Crypto++ is documented through inline comments in header files, which are
processed through Doxygen to produce an HTML reference manual. You can find
a link to the manual from http://www.cryptopp.com. Also at that site is
the Crypto++ FAQ, which you should browse through before attempting to 
use this library, because it will likely answer many of questions that
may come up.

If you run into any problems, please try the Crypto++ mailing list.
The subscription information and the list archive are available on
http://www.cryptopp.com. You can also email me directly by visiting
http://www.weidai.com, but you will probably get a faster response through
the mailing list.
