MCServer
========

**Current Protocol Supported:** Minecraft v1.2 -> v1.7 **Beta ! (before 2011)**

MCServer is a performant C++ Minecraft server designed for use in memory and cpu-limited places, or just to make regular server perform better.

MCServer can run on PCs, Macs, and *nix. This includes android phones and tablets as well as Raspberry Pis. 

Installation
------------

To install MCServer, you can either download the repository and compile it, or download a pre-compiled version.

If you've cloned the repository using Git, you need to pull down the submodules (core plugins, some dependencies). This can be achieved with `git submodule init` and then on a regular basis (to keep up to date) `git submodule update`.

If you downloaded a ZIP file of the sources instead, you will need to download PolarSSL, too, from https://github.com/polarssl/polarssl , and unpack it into the `lib/polarssl` folder. You will also need to manually download all the plugins that you want included.

Compilation instructions are available in the COMPILING file.

Linux builds can be downloaded from [Bearbin's CI Service](http://ci.bearbin.net) and Windows builds from xoft's [nightly build service](http://mc-server.xoft.cz).

After you've extracted the files, simply run the MCServer executable.
