MCServer
========

MCServer is a performant C++ Minecraft server designed for use in memory and cpu-limited places, or just to make regular server perform better.

MCServer can run on PCs, Macs, and *nix. This includes android phones and tablets as well as Raspberry Pis. 

Installation
------------

To install MCServer, you can either download the repository and compile it, or download a pre-compiled version.

If you are cloning the repository, you are required to recursively download the submodules also with `git clone -r`. When pulling, you should use `git pull --recurse-submodules`. You might want to set the base forms as aliases to these.

Compilation instructions are available in the COMPILING file.

Linux builds can be downloaded from [the Berboe CI server](http://ci.berboe.co.uk) and windows from xoft's [nightly build service](http://mc-server.xoft.cz).

After you've extracted the files, simply run the MCServer executable.
