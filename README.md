========

MCServer is a Minecraft server that is written in C++ and designed to be efficient with memory and CPU, as well as having a flexible Lua Plugin API.

MCServer can run on PCs, Macs, and *nix. This includes android phones and tablets as well as Raspberry Pis. 

We currently support the protocol from Minecraft 1.2 all the way up to Minecraft 1.7.10.

Installation
------------

Normally, you will want to download a pre-compiled version of MCServer from one of the buildservers:

 * [Linux and Raspberry Pi](http://ci.bearbin.net) (Bearbin's CI Server)
 * [Windows](http://mc-server.xoft.cz) (xoft's nightly build service)

You simply need to download and extract these files before you can use the server. 

If you're a more advanced user, you may want to compile the server yourself for more performance. See the [COMPILING.md](https://github.com/mc-server/MCServer/blob/master/COMPILING.md) file for more details.
