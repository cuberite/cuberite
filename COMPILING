COMPILING
=========

To compile MCServer on *nix, you need a GNUmake-compatible make that reads GNUmakefile.
Run "make" to build a debug version (slow, but gives more info on crash)
Run "make release=1" to build a release version (fast, less info on crash)
Add addm32=1 to compile in 32-bit mode on 64-bit systems.
