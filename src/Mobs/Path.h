/** The pathfinder has 3 types of cells (cPathCell).
1 - empty. m_IsSolid is false, m_IsSpecial is false.  Air cells are always traversable by A*.
2 - occupied / solid. m_IsSolid is true, m_IsSpecial is false.  Air cells are never traversable by A*.
3 - Special. m_IsSolid is true, m_IsSpecial is true. These cells are special: They may either behave as empty
or as occupied / solid, depending on the mob's direction of movement. For instance, an airblock above a fence is a special cell,
because when mobs attempt to travel to it by jumping, it acts as a solid. But when mobs fall and land on top of a fence,
it acts as air. Special cells include: Doors, ladders, trapdoors, water, gates.

The main function which handles special blocks is SpecialIsSolidFromThisDirection.
This function receives a BlockType, a meta, and a direction of travel,
then it uses those 3 parameters to decide whether the special block should behave as a solid or as air in this
particular direction of travel.

Currently, only fences and water are handled properly. The function always returns "true" (meaning: treat as occuiped/solid) for
the rest of the blocks. This will be fixed once the physics engine issues are fixed. */
