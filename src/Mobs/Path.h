	Note that if you have a man-sized mob (1x1x2, zombies, etc), you are advised to call this function without parameters
	because the declaration might change in later version of the pathFinder, and a parameter-less call always assumes a man-sized mob.

	If your mob is not man-sized, you are advised to use cPath(width, height), this would be compatible with future versions,
	but please be aware that as of now those parameters will be ignored and your mob will be assumed to be man sized.

	@param a_BoundingBoxWidth the character's boundingbox width in blocks. Currently the parameter is ignored and 1 is assumed.
