// DeadlockDetect.h

// Declares the cDeadlockDetect class that tries to detect deadlocks and aborts the server when it detects one

/*
This class simply monitors each world's m_WorldAge, which is expected to grow on each tick.
If the world age doesn't grow for several seconds, it's either because the server is super-overloaded,
or because the world tick thread hangs in a deadlock. We presume the latter and therefore kill the server.
Once we learn to write crashdumps programmatically, we should do so just before killing, to enable debugging.
