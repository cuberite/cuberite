Acts as a generic SSL encryptor / decryptor between the two endpoints. The "owner" of this class is expected
to create it, initialize it and then provide the means of reading and writing data through the SSL link.
This is an abstract base class, there are descendants that handle the specific aspects of how the SSL peer
data comes into the system:
	- cBufferedSslContext uses a cByteBuffer to read and write the data
	- cCallbackSslContext uses callbacks to provide the data
