then do some action on them. While the object is enabled, the chunks contained within are locked and will
not unload

/** Makes chunks stay loaded until this object is cleared or destroyed
Works by setting internal flags in the cChunk that it should not be unloaded.
To optimize for speed, cChunkStay has an Enabled flag, it will "stay" the chunks only when enabled
and it will refuse chunk-list manipulations when enabled.
The object itself is not made thread-safe, it's supposed to be used from a single thread only.
This class is abstract, the descendants are expected to provide the OnChunkAvailable() and
the OnAllChunksAvailable() callback implementations. Note that those are called from the contexts of
different threads' - the caller, the Loader or the Generator thread.
