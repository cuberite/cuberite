/*
Being a descendant of cWindowOwner means that the class can own one window. That window can be 
queried, opened by other players, closed by players and finally destroyed.
Also, a cWindowOwner can be queried for the block coords where the window is displayed. That will be used
for entities / players in motion to close their windows when they get too far away from the window "source".
