it was first being designed in order to make mobs spawn / despawn / act
as the behaviour and even life of mobs depends on the distance to closest player

as side effect : it also collect the chunks that are elligible for spawning
as side effect 2 : it also know the caps for mobs number and can compare census to this numbers
