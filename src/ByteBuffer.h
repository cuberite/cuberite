// Interfaces to the cByteBuffer class representing a ringbuffer of bytes

/** An object that can store incoming bytes and lets its clients read the bytes sequentially
The bytes are stored in a ringbuffer of constant size; if more than that size
is requested, the write operation fails.
The bytes stored can be retrieved using various ReadXXX functions; these assume that the needed
number of bytes are present in the buffer (ASSERT; for performance reasons).
The reading doesn't actually remove the bytes, it only moves the internal read ptr.
To remove the bytes, call CommitRead().
To re-start reading from the beginning, call ResetRead().
This class doesn't implement thread safety, the clients of this class need to provide
their own synchronization.
