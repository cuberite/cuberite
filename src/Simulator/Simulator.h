/** Base class for all block-based physics simulators (such as fluid, fire, falling blocks etc.).
Each descendant provides an implementation of what needs to be done on each world tick.
The descendant may choose to do all processing in a single call for the entire world (Simulate())
or do per-chunk calculations (SimulateChunk()).
Whenever a block is changed, the WakeUp() functions are called to notify all simulators by the simulator manager.
The functions are invoked to add all affected blocks and their direct neighbors using the AddBlock() function.
The simulator may update its internal state based on this call. */
