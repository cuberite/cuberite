/** The fire simulator takes care of the fire blocks.
It periodically increases their meta ("steps") until they "burn out"; it also supports the forever burning netherrack.
Each individual fire block gets stored in per-chunk data; that list is then used for fast retrieval.
The data value associated with each coord is used as the number of msec that the fire takes until
it progresses to the next step (blockmeta++). This value is updated if a neighbor is changed.
The simulator reads its parameters from the ini file given to the constructor.
