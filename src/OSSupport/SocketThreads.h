// SocketThreads.h

// Interfaces to the cSocketThreads class representing the heart of MCS's client networking.
// This object takes care of network communication, groups sockets into threads and uses as little threads as possible for full read / write support
// For more detail, see http://forum.mc-server.org/showthread.php?tid=327

/*
Additional details:
When a client wants to terminate the connection, they call the RemoveClient() function. This calls the
callback one last time to read all the available outgoing data, putting it in the slot's m_OutgoingData
buffer. Then it marks the slot as having no callback. The socket is kept alive until its outgoing data
queue is empty, then shutdown is called on it and finally the socket is closed after a timeout.
If at any time within this the remote end closes the socket, then the socket is closed directly.
As soon as the socket is closed, the slot is finally removed from the SocketThread.
The graph in $/docs/SocketThreads States.gv shows the state-machine transitions of the slot.
