// ChunkSender.h

// Interfaces to the cChunkSender class representing the thread that waits for chunks becoming ready (loaded / generated) and sends them to clients

/*
The whole thing is a thread that runs in a loop, waiting for either:
	"finished chunks" (ChunkReady()), or
	"chunks to send" (QueueSendChunkTo())
to come to a queue.
And once they do, it requests the chunk data and sends it all away, either
	broadcasting (ChunkReady), or
	sends to a specific client (QueueSendChunkTo)
Chunk data is queried using the cChunkDataCallback interface.
It is cached inside the ChunkSender object during the query and then processed after the query ends.
Note that the data needs to be compressed only after the query finishes,
because the query callbacks run with ChunkMap's CS locked.

A client may remove itself from all direct requests(QueueSendChunkTo()) by calling RemoveClient();
this ensures that the client's Send() won't be called anymore by ChunkSender.
Note that it may be called by world's BroadcastToChunk() if the client is still in the chunk.
