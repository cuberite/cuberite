// PieceGenerator.h

// Declares the cBFSPieceGenerator class and cDFSPieceGenerator class 
// representing base classes for generating structures composed of individual "pieces"

/*
Each uses a slightly different approach to generating:
	- DFS extends pieces one by one until it hits the configured depth (or can't connect another piece anymore),
		then starts looking at adjacent connectors (like depth-first search).
	- BFS keeps a pool of currently-open connectors, chooses one at random and tries to place a piece on it,
		thus possibly extending the pool of open connectors (like breadth-first search).
