/*
Declares the cPrefab class, representing a cPiece descendant for the cPieceGenerator that
uses a prefabricate in a cBlockArea for drawing itself.
The class can be constructed from data that is stored directly in the executable, in a sPrefabDef structure
declared in this file as well; the Gallery server exports areas in this format.
