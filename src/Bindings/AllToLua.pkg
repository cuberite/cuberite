// AllToLua.pkg

// Defines the bindings that are exported to Lua by the ToLua processor

/*
	Each file referenced in the $cfile is parsed by ToLua, and bindings are generated for classes and functions
marked with "// tolua_export", or between the "// tolua_begin" and "// tolua_end" markers.

  Note that if class D inherits from class B, then class B needs to be parsed before class D, otherwise the
inheritance doesn't work properly (#1789).
