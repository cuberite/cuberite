/** Represents the state of a single block (previously known as "block meta").
The state consists of a map of string -> string, plus a mechanism for fast equality checks between two BlockState instances.
Once a BlockState instance is created, it is then immutable - there's no way of changing it, only by creating a (modified) copy.
A BlockState instance can be created from hard-coded data or from dynamic data:
	BlockState bs({{"key1", "value1"}, {key2", "value2"}});  // Hard-coded
	- or -
	std::map<AString, AString> map({{"key1", "value1"}, {key2", "value2"}});
	map["key3"] = "value3";
	BlockState bs(map);  // From dynamic data
