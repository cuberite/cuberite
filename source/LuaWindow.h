/** A window that has been created by a Lua plugin and is handled entirely by that plugin
This object needs extra care with its lifetime management:
- It is created by Lua, so Lua expects to garbage-collect it later
- normal cWindow objects are deleted in their ClosedByPlayer() function if the last player closes them
To overcome this, this object overloads the Destroy functions, which doesn't let the ClosedByPlayer()
delete the window, but rather leaves it dangling, with only Lua having the reference to it.
Additionally, to forbid Lua from deleting this object while it is used by players, the manual bindings for
cPlayer:OpenWindow check if the window is of this class, and if so, make a global Lua reference for this object.
This reference needs to be unreferenced in the Destroy() function.
