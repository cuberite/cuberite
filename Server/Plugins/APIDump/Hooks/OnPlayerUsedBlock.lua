			This hook is called after a {{cPlayer|player}} has right-clicked a block that can be used, such as a
			{{cChestEntity|chest}} or a lever. It is called after Cuberite processes the usage (sends the UI
			handling packets / toggles redstone). Note that for UI-related blocks, the player is most likely
			still using the UI. This is a notification-only event.</p>
			<p>
			Note that the block coords given in this callback are for the (solid) block that is being clicked,
			not the air block between it and the player.</p>
			<p>
			To get the world at which the right-click occurred, use the {{cPlayer}}:GetWorld() function.</p>
			<p>
			See also the {{OnPlayerUsingBlock|HOOK_PLAYER_USING_BLOCK}} for a similar hook called before the
			use, the {{OnPlayerUsingItem|HOOK_PLAYER_USING_ITEM}} and {{OnPlayerUsedItem|HOOK_PLAYER_USED_ITEM}}
			for similar hooks called when a player interacts with any block with a usable item in hand, such as
			a bucket.
