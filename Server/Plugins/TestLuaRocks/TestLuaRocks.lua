-- TestLuaRocks.lua

-- This is a mockup plugin that does a quick test of LuaRocks capability in Cuberite

-- "Success" is when the plugin loads, downloads the forum webpage and displays the headers and length and then displays both libs as loaded.
-- "Failure" usually manifests as one of the "require" lines failing, although you have the luarock installed.
-- Note that the plugin deliberately never fully loads, so that it can be reloaded fast by pressing its Enable button in the webadmin's plugin list.
