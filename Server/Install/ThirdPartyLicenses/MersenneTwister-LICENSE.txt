// The Mersenne Twister is an algorithm for generating random numbers.  It
// was designed with consideration of the flaws in various other generators.
// The period, 2^19937-1, and the order of equidistribution, 623 dimensions,
// are far greater.  The generator is also fast; it avoids multiplication and
// division, and it benefits from caches and pipelines.  For more information
// see the inventors' web page at
// http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html
