========

MCServer is a Minecraft server that is written in C++ and designed to be efficient with memory and CPU, as well as having a flexible Lua Plugin API.

MCServer can run on Windows, *nix and Android operating systems. This includes Android phones and tablets as well as Raspberry Pis. 

We currently support Release 1.7 and 1.8 (not beta) Minecraft protocol versions.

Installation
------------
Hosted MCServer is available DIY on DigitalOcean [http://doinstall.bearbin.net/install?url=https://github.com/mc-server/MCServer]: Install on DigitalOcean and Gamososm [https://gamocosm.com/] also offers MCServer support.

For Linux there is an easy installation method, just run this in your terminal:
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcserver/MCServer/master/easyinstall.sh | sh

For Windows, you just need to download a file and extract it:

Windows 32 bit
Windows 64 bit
[https://github.com/mc-server/MCServer] (Scroll down to Installation and click on either the 32 bit or 64 bit depending on operating system.)

For other operating systems you need to download and compile yourself. There is also an archive of binary builds on the buildserver: [http://builds.cuberite.org]

Compiling the server yourself has other benefits: you may get better performance performance (1.5-3x as fast) and it supports more operating systems. See the COMPILING.md file for more details.
